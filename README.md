# SickleClinix

**An ML-powered mobile diagnostic app to aid with the early detection of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) with explainable analysis**


## Overview

**SickleClinix** is a mobile-first healthcare application designed to assist in the early detection and management of Sickle Cell Disease, particularly in under-resourced healthcare settings. The system leverages computer vision, machine learning, and mobile technology to analyze blood smear images, predict SCD presence, with a Grad-CAM for explainability((Helps healthcare workers to know which part of the image influenced the model's decision).


## Objectives

- Detect Sickle Cell Disease using a trained CNN on blood smear images.
- Provide explainable predictions using Grad-CAM.
- Enable role-based access (doctor, nurse, lab technician, admin).
- Offer offline-first support with optional cloud sync.
- Deliver triage, historical tracking, reports, and educational materials.
- Improve healthcare accessibility for vulnerable populations.


## Core Features

- **Image Classification (Normal vs Sickle)** using MobileNetV2.
- **Grad-CAM Explainability** for heatmap overlays.
- **Flutter Mobile App** with modern UI.
- **Offline Support** with local storage.
- **Role-based Dashboards** and secure login system.
- **Triage & Severity Assessment** from image results.
- **Reports, History, Notifications, Educational Content**
